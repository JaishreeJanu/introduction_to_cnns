This work contains implementation of CNNs for image classification on CIFAR dataset. 

**Network archtitecture of the CNN is :**

conv1 (with RELU), pool1 (max pooling), conv2 (with RELU), conv3 (with RELU), pool2 (max pooling), FC1 (with RELU), FC2 (with RELU), FC3 (with RELU), softmax layer.

The primary objective of the work is to get fine-grain control over the network by techniques such as Normalization, regularization and Optimizers. The PDF contains the train and test accuracy plots for different values of parameters.
